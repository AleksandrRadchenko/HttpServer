# Allows using different Gradle versions with http://codeship.io
#
# As @altfatterz points out below this isn't necessary if you choose to check in your .gradle and gradlew.bat/gradlew.sh files.
#   I prefer not to check-in the generated files so I set this up.
#
# We update the path here instead of via the environment variables because you cannot control the order
#  that environment variables are set in the Environment tab, and this results in the path NOT having the version number
#  see test_commands for info on how to run gradle without settings the path here if you want to avoid it.
#
# Codeship defaults to jdk7, so you may also want to run the following command to switch to jdk8
# jdk_switcher use oraclejdk8
